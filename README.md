# Hydration Tracker Widget 💧

Hi everyone! I built a **Hydration Tracker** widget to help you track your daily water intake.  

It's a simple project, but it was super fun to create and gave me hands-on experience with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  


- Track the number of glasses of water you drink each day
- See remaining glasses toward your daily goal
- Animated water icon and progress bar
- Goal achievement feedback

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click the **"Add Glass"** button to log a glass of water.
3. Watch your progress update in real-time!


- Practiced DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Styled a responsive UI using CSS
- Learned to link HTML, CSS, and JS for a functional widget

Feel free to try it out and give feedback! 🌟
